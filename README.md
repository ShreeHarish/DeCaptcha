# DeCaptcha
A simple fast ML model trained over a defined captcha dataset that is capable of deciphering captcha images.

# The Dataset

The dataset was provided as a part of assignment for the course CS771 at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, during Summer Term 2022.

The dataset consists of 2000 synthetically generated images with 4 hex characters in each.

Each image has a light background color with comparatively darker color for the characters.

There are some lines in the background which are guarenteed to be not as thick as the characters itself.
